## Reflection
This Agile meeting was detrimental to the team as 
we begin to flesh out our app. As we hone in our project, 
roles, routes, and desired learnings, it is important we organize ourselves
to get the most out of the project. By following a structured standup while
following through on deadlines, the team can continue building a
strong foundation for this app and team throughout the
semester.
