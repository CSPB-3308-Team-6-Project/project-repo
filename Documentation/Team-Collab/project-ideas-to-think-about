# Project Ideas to Think About

## Types

- Think about what kind of Types we will need for our database.
- We are declaring what type each 
- Example:
```
export interface ITrackerType = {

	_id: string;
	name: string;
	userID: string;
	description: string;
	createdAt: Date;
	updatedAt: Date;
	
}

const myTracker = {

  _id: "0",
  name: "Carl",
  userID: "1",
  description: "A tracker type",
  createAt: new Date(),
  updatedAt: new Date(),

} as ITrackType
```

## Routes

- Do we want just health/wellness route?
- What pages do we need to be fetching data from the database?
- What pages do we need to be creating/editing/deleting to the database?
- Do we want modals? Popovers? Or all in one page (doubt it but just saying)
- What kind of menu/nav?

## Colors

- What sorts of colors will our theme have?
- We will need to make sure we use these color schemes in everything we do and share components

## Work split

- How much do you want to do with HTML/CSS (Frontend) or SQL (Backend)?

## Component Sharing

- Do we make a button and share it? Or do we not worry about components to share?
