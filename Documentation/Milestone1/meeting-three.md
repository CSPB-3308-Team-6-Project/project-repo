# Meeting 3 Agenda

## Open to team to discuss thoughts, updates, ideas, feelings, etc.

## Go through updated README

## Decide on Stack
  - Tried to make sure everyone's desires for this project were heard (please make sure you tell me if this is wrong
    - Conner/Linda want to learn more about HTML/CSS
    - Ledy wants to learn SQL, potentially HTML/CSS?
   
## Discuss next steps, splitting work
  - My thoughts were that if the above is correct we can do the following
    - Have Conner and Linda split up pages and UI either by components/pages
      - Let them decide
    - Ledy backend and database set up
    - Carl helping out, tying front-end to back-end
  - If this is wrong, please let me know
