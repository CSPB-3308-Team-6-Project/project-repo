# Team 6 Project README
_In alignment with Milestone 1, this README has been created with the following information_

## Project Title
Health Tracker - General Health/feeling with numerical answers to basic questions + stats/graphs/report

```
NOTES: 
Ideas for Proposal: 
  1. Work out app that directs you specific work outs and videos for workouts
    - Logging of workout sessions
  2. Calorie tracker with math based on variables (personal and external)
    - Sport/Weather/Body weight
  3. Animal care tracking
  4. Injury Tracking
    - Yes/no questions
    - 
  6. Health Tracking
    - How many glasses of water? How many hours of sleep? etc.
    - 

     Tracker--
       - Guidance based on the user
       - Prompts after a track to see how the results are -> gives report at end
    


     (Wants to make sure this will be something we can all track and connect with so we can see growth as use ourselves as a growth)

## Vision Statement - Linda
Heath Tracker is a personal web application designed to help an individual track progress on variables that support general health and well-being. The application will allow users to easily track data such as amount of water, sleep, exercise, general nutrition, etc. each day and provide reporting to the user can see progress. 

---

## Motivation - Linda
People generally know what is recommended for general health and well-being, but keeping track of progress is hard, especially if the recommendations are not already a part of your normal habits. Using an easy interface to track daily activities can help provide gentle reminders and reports can sustain motivation for continued progress and habit building.

## Risks to Project Completion - Ledy
### Communication Gaps in a Remote Environment
Because the team operates entirely remotely, there is an increased risk of miscommunication, delayed responses, or unclear expectations regarding task ownership and deliverables. 

### Time Underestimation
Software development tasks may take longer than anticipated due to debugging, integration issues, and unforeseen technical challenges. There is also a risk of not allocating sufficient time to properly design, implement, and test specific features. 

### Technical Challenges and Learning Curves
Some team members will be working with new programming languages, frameworks, or development tools for the first time. This learning curve may slow early development and introduce errors as concepts are being learned and applied simultaneously.

---

## Mitigation Strategy - Conner
### Clear Communication Practices
To reduce miscommunication and unclear expectations, the team will hold consistent weekly meetings and use a shared communication platform for day-to-day questions and updates. Tasks will be clearly defined and tracked in a shared project board to ensure ownership and visibility. Meeting notes and decisions will be documented to keep everyone aligned and prevent misunderstandings.

### Incremental Progress Tracking
To avoid underestimating time, the team will break features into small tasks and track progress against initial estimates. If a task begins taking longer than expected, it will be reevaluated, simplified, or redistributed among team members. Regular progress check-ins will allow the team to adust priorities so any delays do not block overall development. 

### Early Familiarization with Technology
To address learning curves, the team will decide on a technology stack early and spend initial time experimenting with setup and small prototypes. Team members will collaborate through code reviews and shared debugging sessions, and documnetation will be maintained to help everyone understand design decisions and implementation details.

---

## Development Method

The TRACKERS will follow an Agile, sprint-based approach with weekly planning meetings,
short development iterations, and continuous integration. Each task will be broken into
small, testable components, allowing the project to adapt based on progress and
challenges.

---

## Development Steps

(I will update this more once we meet and decide some initial stuff so this is more steps rather than a checklist)

  1. Decide stack
  2. Discuss Routes, Types, Pages, and Experience
  3. Assign work
  4. Build initial app and get everyone access
  5. Build routes
  6. Add supporting pages
  7. Stylize
  8. Finalize

## Project Tracking

The Project Tracking is done via Github within the Organization we are all a part of (Prof included). [Here is a link to the Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/CSPB-3308-Team-6-Project/projects/3)
