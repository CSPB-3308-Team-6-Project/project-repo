## Vision Statement
StudySync is a collaborative web application designed to help small student teams
plan study sessions, coordinate availability, and track shared academic goals. The
platform supports both synchronous and asynchronous collaboration by combining
scheduling tools, task tracking, and progress visualization in one place.

---

## Motivation
Many students struggle to coordinate group work across different schedules, time
zones, and course loads, often relying on fragmented tools like shared documents,
group chats, and calendars. StudySync aims to simplify this process by providing a
single, purpose-built platform that makes planning, accountability, and
communication more transparent for student teams.

---

## Risks to Project Completion
- **Scheduling and Coordination Challenges:** Team members are in different time
zones, which may limit synchronous development time.
- **Feature Scope Creep:** There is a risk of trying to implement too many
collaboration features within the semester timeline.
- **Learning Curve with Full-Stack Integration:** Some team members have limited
experience connecting frontend interfaces with backend APIs and databases.

---

## Mitigation Strategy
- **Availability Alignment:** The team will rely on asynchronous communication
tools and keep synchronous meetings focused and time-boxed.
- **Minimum Viable Product First:** The initial goal will be a basic, functional
MVP focusing on scheduling and task tracking before adding enhancements.
- **Early Prototyping:** Backend routes and database schemas will be implemented
early to reduce integration risk later in the project.

---
## Development Method
The team will follow an Agile, sprint-based approach with weekly planning meetings,
short development iterations, and continuous integration. Tasks will be broken into
small, testable components, allowing the project to adapt based on progress and
challenges.

---

## Development Steps
1. Define core user stories and functional requirements.
2. Design database schema for users, groups, tasks, and availability.
3. Implement backend API endpoints for scheduling and task management.
4. Build frontend views for calendars, task lists, and progress summaries.
5. Integrate frontend and backend components.
6. Conduct testing and prepare final presentation and documentation.

---

## Project Tracking
The team will use Trello to track tasks, sprint progress, and blockers. Tasks will
be labeled by priority and assigned to individual team members to maintain
accountability.

---

## Technology Stack
### Frontend
- HTML/CSS for layout and styling
- JavaScript with React for interactive UI components
### Backend
- Python with Flask for RESTful API development
### Database
- SQLite for development, with the option to migrate to PostgreSQL
